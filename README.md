# hello-universe
This is an app to communicate with all life forms out there in the universe.
It was built in 2017 by Jeroen Spaander who wasn't that good at programming at all.
Taking this in concideration it was really cool that he was able to write such an advanced piece of work.
He therefor recieved the global universal nobel price.
